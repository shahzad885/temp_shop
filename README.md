TempShot watches your screenshot folder and shows a **floating overlay** the moment a new screenshot is taken — set a timer, and the file deletes itself automatically, even when the app is closed. No servers. Everything is local.

## Features

- **Floating time-picker** — appears over any app when a screenshot is detected
- **Background auto-delete** — files deleted from storage when timer expires, app closed or not
- **The Vault** — long-press any screenshot to keep it forever
- **Netflix-style UI** — hero banner, horizontal category lanes, ripple-animated stats
- **100% on-device** — Hive database, zero network requests

## Stack
